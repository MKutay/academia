Hello! I am Mehmet Kutay, a high school student in Turkey. I am taking a double diploma, one of which is the Turkish national curriculum and the other is the IB diploma programme. This website is going to be a place where I store all of my writings and essays I write while I am in high school. I will also add my notes I took for the exams and for the courses I take.
